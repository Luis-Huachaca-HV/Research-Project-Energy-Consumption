# Scheduler-Plugins with EnergyScore ‚ö°Ô∏è

This directory ships the **EnergyScore plugin** and the patches required to integrate it into the official Kubernetes Scheduler-Plugins project.

---

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the official repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins.git
   cd scheduler-plugins
   ```

2. Copy the EnergyScore plugin into the new `pkg`:

   ```bash
   cp -r ../Research-Project-Energy-Consumption/scheduler-plugins/pkg/energyscore pkg/
   ```

3. Apply the patches:

   ```bash
   git apply ../Research-Project-Energy-Consumption/scheduler-plugins/patches/*.patch
   ```

4. Copy configs:

   ```bash
   cp ../Research-Project-Energy-Consumption/scheduler-plugins/configs/*.yaml ./config/
   ```

---

### 1. Install Go (latest version recommended)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go -y
```

Or grab the latest tarball from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).

---

### 2. Clean deps & fetch modules

From the root of `scheduler-plugins`:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

---

### 3. Build the scheduler

```bash
make build
```

This will generate the scheduler binary at:

```
_bin/kube-scheduler
```

---

### 4. Run your patched scheduler

Test it in your cluster (kind, minikube, whatever):

```bash
_bin/kube-scheduler --config energy-score-config.yaml --v=4
```

---

## ‚ö° Notes

* Changes in `apis/config/v1/...` and `pkg/energyscore/` add **new types + plugin logic** ‚Üí make sure your `energy-score-config.yaml` points to `pkg/energyscore/`.
* If `make build` fails due to missing generated code (deepcopy, conversion, defaults), regenerate with:

  ```bash
  make update
  ```

  This runs `hack/update-codegen.sh` and refreshes the `zz_generated.*.go` files.

---

## Quick & Dirty Re-run üöÄ

2. Build your patched scheduler again:

```bash
cd scheduler-plugins
make build
```

‚Üí Binary lands in `_bin/kube-scheduler`.

3. Launch it with your config (separate terminal):

```bash
_bin/kube-scheduler --config /path/to/energy-score-config.yaml --v=4
```

* `--config` ‚Üí must point to your YAML.
* `--v=4` ‚Üí debug-level logs (handy to confirm EnergyScore is actually loaded).
* This scheduler will run on your host, connected to the cluster, under the name `energy-scheduler`.

## Use EnergyScore in Pods üß™

Create a test pod (e.g. `energy_test.yaml`) with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f energy_test.yaml
```

And watch your pod get scheduled using the EnergyScore logic.
